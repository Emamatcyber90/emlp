Exercise 2.1.2

The following ML "expressions" have errors in them.  Explain what is wrong with
each.

(a) 8/4
    The '/' operator is only specified for 'real' arguments, the intent was
    probably 'div'.

(b) if 2<3 then 4
    There is no 'else' portion.

(c) 1<2 and 5>3
    'and' is 'not' an operator for 'bool', the intent was probably 'andalso'.

(d) 6+7 DIV 2
    'DIV' is not an operator bound to any name, the intent was probably 'div'.

(e) 4.+3.5
    '4.' does not parse to a valid expression, the intent was probably '4.0'.

(f) 1.0<2.0 or 3>4
    'and' is 'not' an operator for 'bool', the intent was probably 'orelse'.

(g) #"a"^#"b"
    '^' is not an operator 'char'.

(h) 123.
    There is a trailing '.', the intent was either '123 : int' or '123.0 :
    real'.

(i) 1.0 = 2.0
    The '=' operator is not defined for 'real' operands, the intent was
    probably a fuzzy comparison.
