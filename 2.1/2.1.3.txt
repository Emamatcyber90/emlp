Exercise 2.1.3

Write a string that when printed creates the displayed text on lines (3)-(5) of
Example 2.6 [1].  You may assume that the indentation of the lines is made by a
single tab character.  Your string should be written over several lines so that
there are no more than 80 characters appearing on any one line.

[1] The lines follow:
"\\\" stands for the double-quote character, \
\which otherwise would be interpreted \
\as the string ender."

The solution follows.
"\"\\\\\\\" stands for the double-quote character, \\\n\
\\\which otherwise would be interted \\\n\
\\\as the string ender.\""
