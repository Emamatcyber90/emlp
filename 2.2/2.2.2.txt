Exercise 2.2.2

The following expressions contain type errors.  What are the errors and how
might we fix them?

(a) ceil(4)
    'ceil' is defined for 'real' operands only.  Try 'ceil(4.0)'.

(b) if true then 5+6 else 7.0
    The two branches of the 'if-then-else' do not agree on their types.  There
    are two possible solutions: 'if true then real(5+6) else 7.0' and 'if true
    then 5+6 else floor(7.0)'.

(c) chr(256)
    'chr' is only defined for the range [0, 256).  The intent of 'chr(256)' is
    unclear and there is no real solution without additional context.

(d) chr(~1)
    'chr' is only defined for the range [0, 256).  The intent of 'chr(~1)' is
    unclear and there is no real solution without additional context.

(e) ord(3)
    'ord' is only defined for 'char's.  The intent is unclear, though possibly
    the user meant 'chr(3)'.

(f) chr(#"a")
    'chr' is only defined for 'int's.  The intent is unclear, though possibly
    the user meant 'ord(#"a")'.

(g) if 0 then 1 else 2
    The expression following 'if' must be of type 'boolean'.  'if false then 1
    else 2' is likely the intention.

(h) ord("a")
    'ord' is only defined for 'char' not 'string'.  The user likely meant
    'ord(#"a")'.
