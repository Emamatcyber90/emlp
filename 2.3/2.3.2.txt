Exercise 2.3.2

Show the effect on the environment of making the following sequence of val-
declarations.  Which variables are now accessible?

val a = 3;
val b = 98.6;
val a = "three";
val c = a^str(chr(floor(b)));

c := "threeb"
a := "three"
b := 98.6
a := 3

The 'val a = 3' is no longer accessible.
