Exercise 3.2.2

In the following function definition
    fun foo(a, b, c, d) =
        if a = b then c + 1 else
            if a > b then c else b + d
it is possible to deduce that a, b, c, and d are all integers.  Explain how ML
makes these deductions.

1. Since '1' is an integer, then for the expression 'c + 1' to be valid, 'c'
   must be an integer.

2. Since 'c' is an integer due to (1), then for the expression 'if a > b then c
   else b + d' to be valid, 'c' and 'b + d' must be the same type, i.e.
   integers.

3. Since 'b + d' is an integer, then 'b' and 'd' must be integers.

4. Since 'b' is an integer, then for the expression 'a = b' to be valid, 'a'
   must be an integer.

Therefore all of a, b, c, and d must be integers.
