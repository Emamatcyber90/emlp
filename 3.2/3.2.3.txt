Exercise 3.2.3

Suppose we define a function f by a statement that begins
    fun f(a:int, b, c, d, e) = ...

Tell what can be inferred about the types b, c, d, and/or e if the body of the
function is each of the following if-then-else statements:

(a) if a < b + c then d else e
    b, c are integers, d and e are equal but unknown types.

(b) if a < b then c else d
    b is an integer, c and d are equal but unknown types and e is an unknown
    type.

(c) if a < b then b + c else d + e
    b, c, d and e are all integers.

(d) if a < b then b < c else d
    b and c are integers, d is a bool.

(e) if b < c then a else c + d
    b, c, d and e are all integers.

(f) if b < c then d else e
    b and c are equal and comparable but unknown types.  d and e are equal but
    unknown types.

(g) if b < c then d + e else d * e
    b and c are equal and comparable but unknown types.  d and e are either
    both integers or both reals.
