Exercise 3.2.4

Consider the factorial function 'fact' described in Exercise 3.2.1(a); if you
have not written this function, use the published solution.  Describe the
changes to the environment that occur as a result of a call to fact(4).

For easy of reference, the 'fact' function is reproduced below.

    fun fact(n) = if n = 1 then 1 else n * fact(n - 1);

At its largest, the environment looks as follows:

    n := 1
    fact(1)
    n := 2
    fact(2)
    n := 3
    fact(3)
    n := 4
    fact(4)
    fact

And then as the functions complete, these values are removed from the top down.
