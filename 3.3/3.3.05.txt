Exercise 3.3.5

Does the pattern of Fig. 3.15(a) match the following expressions?  If so give
the value bindings for each of the variables, x, y, zs, and w.

For reference, the pattern is constructed from (x::y::zs, w).

(a) (["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e"])
    x  = "a"
    y  = "b"
    zs = ["c"]
    w  = ["d", "e"]

(b) (["a", "b"], 4.5)
    x  = "a"
    y  = "b"
    zs = nil
    w  = 4.5

(c) ([5], [6, 7])
    No - too many values to unpack from [5] to x::y::zs.
