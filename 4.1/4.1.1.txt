Exercise 4.1.1

If we were to change line (1) of Fig. 4.2 to

  fun printList(nil) = 0

and leave the rest of printList as it is, would there be a type error in the
function printList?

Fig 4.2 follows.

fun printList(nil) = ()
  | printList(x::xs) = (
        print(Int.toString(x));
        print("\n");
        printList(xs)
    );

There would not be a type error, since the basis case evaluates to an Int and
the recursive case evaluates to a statement list, whose last item evaluates to
an Int.
