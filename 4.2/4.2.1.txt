Exercise 4.2.1

Write expressions that will do the following:

(a) Open file 'zap' for reading.
    openIn("zap")

(b) Close the file whose instream is 'in1'.
    close(in1)

(c) Read 5 characters from the instream 'in2'.
    inputN(in2, 5)

(d) Read a line of text from the instream 'in3'.
    let val SOME line = inputLine(in3) in line end

(e) Read the entire file from instream 'in4'.
    inputAll(in4)

(f) Find the first character waiting on standard input without consuming it.
    let val SOME x = lookahead(stdIn) in x end

(g) Find how many characters are presently waiting on standard input.
    fun scan1(instream, NONE)   = 0
      | scan1(instream, SOME _) = 1 + scan1(instream, input1(instream));
    scan1(stdIn, input1(stdIn));
