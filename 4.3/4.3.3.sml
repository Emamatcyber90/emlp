(*
Exercise 4.3.3

Write a function that, given i prints 2^i X's, using i recursive calls.  Hint:
use an auxiliary function that computes the desired string before the string is
printed.
*)

(* This question is almost verbatim identical to that of Exercise 4.1.3, and so
the solution is not repeated here. *)
