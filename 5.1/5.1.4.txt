Exercise 5.1.4

Recall from Exercise 2.1.4 that expressions using orelse and andalso can be
rewritten using if-then-else expressions.  We now find that if-then-else
expressions can be rewritten as case expressions.  Write

(a) E orelse F
    case E
    of true  => E
     | false => F;

(b) E andalso F
    case E
    of true  => F
     | false => E
