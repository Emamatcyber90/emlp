Exercise 5.3.2

We can restrict polymorphic types (type expressions with type variables) by:
(i) equating type variables, (ii) replacing a type variable by a constant type,
or (iii) replacing a type variable by a nonconstant expression.  Give an
example of each kind of restriction for the following expressions:

(a) 'a * 'b * int
      (i) 'a = int
     (ii) 'a * int * int
    (iii) 'a * 5 * int

(b) ('a list) * ('b list)
      (i) 'a = int
     (ii) (int list) * ('b list)
    (iii) [5, 20] * ('b list)
