Exercise 5.3.3

Suppose f(x, y, z) is a function.  Give an example of a definition of f that
would cause the argument of f to have each of the following types:

(a) 'a * ''b * ('a -> ''b)
    fun f(x, y, z) = z(x) = y;

(b) 'a * 'a * int
    fun f(x, y, z) = z + 1;

(c) 'a list * 'b * 'a
    fun f(x, y, z) = z::x;

(d) ('a * 'b) * 'a list * 'b list
    fun f((x1, x2), y, z) = (x1::y, x2::z);
