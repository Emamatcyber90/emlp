Exercise 5.3.5

Let L have the value [(1,2),(3,4)], let M have the value (1,2) and N have the
value (3,4).  Which of the following equality tests have the value true?

(a) L = M::[N]
    Yes, this has the true value.

(b) M::N = L@[N]
    No, this does not have the true value.

(c) [(1,2)]@[N] = L@nil
    Yes, this has the true value.

(d) N::L = (3,4)::M::N::nil
    Yes, this has the true value.
