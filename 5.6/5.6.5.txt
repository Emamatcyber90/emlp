Exercise 5.6.5

Repeat Exercise 5.6.4 for the following expressions. The functions compA1 and
compCompA1 are as defined in Exercises 5.6.4(a) and (b).  However, you should
redeclare their type for the uses described below.

a) val f = compA1 real;

   where real is the built-in function that converts integers to equivalent
   reals.

   fun f x = real(add1(x)) : int -> real

b) val compT = comp trunc;

   where trunc is the built-in function that converts a real to an integer,
   rounding towards 0 if necessary.

   fun compT F x = comp trunc F x
                 = F(trunc(x))
   compT : (int -> 'a) -> real -> 'a
   compT : (int -> int) -> real -> int

c) val g = compCompA1 compT;

   fun g F x = (comp (comp add1)) (comp trunc) F x
             = comp trunc (comp add1 F) x
             = (comp add1 F)(trunc(x))
             = F(add1(trunc(x)))
   F : int -> 'a
   g : (int -> 'a) -> real -> 'a

d) val h = g real;
   fun h x = real(add1(trunc(x))) : real -> real

e) f(2);
   tycon mismatch

f) h(3.5);
   4.0

g) h(~3.5);
   ~2.0
