Exercise 7.5.2

Is your solution to Exercise 7.5.1 more efficient than the list-based solution
requested in Exercise 5.2.4? Why or why not?

Both solutions are equivalent as they perform the same number of arithmetic
operations and all the list operations used in the solution to Exercise 5.2.4
are constant time, just like the array operations.
