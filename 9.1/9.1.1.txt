Exercise 9.1.1

The relevant parts of Fig 9.2 is reproduced below:

datatype 'a btree = T of 'a btree * 'a btree |
                    Leaf of 'a;
infix 2 T;

If we instead define infixr 3 T at line (3) of Fig. 9.2, would
the interpretation change for

a) val t = Leaf(1) T Leaf(2) T Leaf(3);

Yes, we would get T(Leaf(1), T(Leaf(2), Leaf(3))).

b) val t = Leaf(1) T (Leaf(2) T Leaf(3) T (Leaf(4) T Leaf(5)));

Yes, we would get T(Leaf(1), T(Leaf(2), T(Leaf(3), T(Leaf(4), Leaf(5))))).
