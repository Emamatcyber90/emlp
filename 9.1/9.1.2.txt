Exercise 9.1.2

Suggest a way to redefine the precedence and/or associativity of + and * so
that

a) a + b * c is interpreted as (a + b) * c, and a * b + c is interpreted as
   (a * b) + c.

infix 7 +

This causes + and * to have the same precedence, and since they are
left-associative, the desired result is obtained.

b) a + b * c + d is interpreted as a + ((b * c) + d).

infixr 6 +

This leaves * to have a higher precedence, but + will now associate (b * c)
with d before it does so with a.
